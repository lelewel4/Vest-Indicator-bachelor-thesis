The engineering diploma thesis describes the design of a signal vest for an electric scooter driver based on wireless communication and STM32 microcontrollers.

The work contains a short introduction to the subject of e-scooters, after which the goal and scope of the project were defined. Existing commercial signal vest solutions were also reviewed. Then, the components enabling wireless communication were analyzed and development kits were selected. The entire project was divided into two parts: transmitting and receiving. Their appropriate functionality and requirements are outlined. Both parts discuss and justify the choice of specific electronic components. Electrical diagrams and printed circuits designed in KiCad are also presented. After this part, the PCBs were manufactured along with the assembly of elements. The subsections devoted to the software present the CubeMX environment, block diagrams, used libraries and interesting fragments of the source code written in C. Then, in the Tinkercad program, the appropriate housings were designed and manufactured in 3D technology. After assembling the project, functional tests were carried out.
The summary contains conclusions and further development directions for the project of a signaling vest for an electric scooter driver.
